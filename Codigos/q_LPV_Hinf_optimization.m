% brief: this function calculates the gain matrix for each vertex of the
% politope. 
% It uses H infinity control and Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy model
% representation. An optimization problem is obtained and as we solve it,
% we obtain the gain matrices.

function out = q_LPV_Hinf_optimization(A, Bu, Bw)
